            <b style = "font-size: 50px;">T</b>oday, most people think that there is too much carbon dioxide on earth, because they cause global warming and other negative effects.
            Oxygen, on the other hand, may seem harmless and important to the human race.
            <br/>
            However, for most of the time in earth's history, carbon dioxide isn't the problem: oxygen is. 
            When there is too little carbon dioxide and too much oxygen, earth becomes extrememly cold!
            <br/>
            About four hundred million years ago, a kind of organism began to grow on land, taking in carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. 
            This eventually led to a massive extinction (85% of marine organisms died) because the ocean is becoming very cold without the carbon dioxide in the air.
            The kind of organism that caused this is officially referred to nowadays, as kingdom <b><i>Plantae</i></b>.

            <b style = "font-size: 50px;">P</b>lants undergo a process called photosynthesis. They take water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
            <br/>
            They have special structures in their cells called chloroplasts. These chloroplasts can use sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen gas. Since oxygen is useless for them, they simply emit it into the atmosphere again.

                <li>Stomata (tiny holes on the surface of the plant made of two cells) let carbon dioxide into the plant.</li>
                <li>Chlorophyll absorb sunlight for chloroplasts to use.</li>
                <li>Photosynthesis undegoes inside chloroplasts, making glucose for the plant to use.</li>
