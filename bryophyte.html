                    Bryophytes must live in very moist conditions, because they don't havevascular tissues, forcing them to transfer water or nutrients from cell to cell.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They have root like structures called rhizoids that hold the plant in place and help absorb water.
                </li>

                    Bryophytes spend most of their life as gametophytes.

                    The sporophytes of a bryophyte are small pods that produce spores.
